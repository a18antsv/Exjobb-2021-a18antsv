Bachelor Degree Project in Informatics with a Specialization in Web Programming

## About The Project
Message-oriented middleware can be used as a common means of communication between services in a micro-service architecture to decouple services and allow for asynchronous communication. An expansion of the system places additional demands on the middleware software; increasing nodes that produce more and more data must not have negative consequences for the rest of the system.

Two common message brokers are Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ, which are examined in this project to find out which one performs best in a system that sees a sharp increase in the number of producers. The study covers the set-up of these systems to increase the number of producers during experiments and to compare the throughput and latency of the two message brokers. One area applied in this study is the collection of measurement values from air quality sensors, which would be the first step in a system that analyzes important data for the future prosperity of humans.
